A dream of a refugee “Tommy Sherif”, who arrived in the Netherlands in 2014
At first he was searching for a refuge, a new start, a new home.
Afterward, he started to continue his journey and persuade his dream of creating more art.

The journey started in 2008 in Egypt, studying theater and filmmaking, learning new skills, and developing himself. 

In 2019 he started our foundation 999 Geen Dienst Studio,
A Dutch word that means “999 no service studio” and there is a funny story behind the name that is only revealed in “Tommy’s stories”.
The dream that started more than a decade ago, found a place to become real in 2019,
the foundation started in the Netherlands,
and in the short period between 2019 and 2021 – including more than a year of pandemic and lock down – 999 Geen Dienst Studio could achieve big leaps and still more to come.
